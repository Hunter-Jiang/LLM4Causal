- How can the smoke.csv data inform us about the specific effect sizes of smoking (smk) on weight changes, both through direct pathways and through indirect pathways mediated by appetite suppression (app_sup)?
- Can we determine the effect size of the causal relationship between smoking (smk) and weight changes in the smoke.csv data, and the effect size of the mediating role of appetite suppression (app_sup)?
- Looking at the smoke.csv data, can we tell how much smoking (smk) influence a person's weight changes, and is a lot of that because of the appetite suppression (app_sup)?

Example 2: given the following information:
- Dataset name: arts_and_culture.csv
- Treatment variable: museum attendance (visitor_count)
- Outcome variable: cultural diversity index (CD)
- Mediator variable: cultural events per capita

The corresponding questions can be:
- When looking at the arts_and_culture.csv, how much does cultural events per capita get in the middle of the effect of museum attendance (visitor_count) on cultural diversity index (CD)?
- In the arts_and_culture.csv, can we figure out how big a role cultural events per capita plays in linking museum attendance (visitor_count) to cultural diversity index (CD)?
- Regarding the data from arts_and_culture.csv, can we distinguish the direct impact of museum attendance (visitor_count) on cultural diversity index (CD) from the indirect impact that operates through cultural events per capita?
